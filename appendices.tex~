\chapter{Pointless extras}
\label{app:Pointless}

Appendixes (or should that be ``appendices''?) make you look really clever, 'cos
it's like you had more clever stuff to say than could be fitted into the main
bit of your thesis. Yeah. So everyone should have at least three of them\dots

Padding? What do you mean?

\section{$y = \alpha x^2$}
\label{sec:EqnTitle}
See, maths in titles automatically goes bold where it should (and check the 
table of contents: it \emph{isn't} bold there!) Check the source: nothing
needs to be specified to make this work. Thanks to Donald Arsenau for the
teeny hack that makes this work.

\section{Noise Filters}
\label{app:noise}

For Calo jets the following criteria were applied:

\begin{itemize}
  \item N90 hits $>$ 1, 
    \item  HBHE $>$ 0.01,
      \item fHPD $<$ 0.98,
\end{itemize}

For PF jets the following criteria were applied~\cite{jetid}.
  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Neutral hadron fraction $<$ 0.99, 
    \item  Neutral EM fraction $<$ 0.99,
      \item Number of constituents $>$ 1,
        \item Charged hadron fraction $>$ 0,
          \item Charged multiplicity $>$ 0,
            \item Charged EM fraction $<$ 0.99.
\end{itemize}
  
The following noise filters are applied, as defined in \cite{met_filters}, to remove events with spurious, non-physical jets or missing transverse energy.

\begin{itemize}
  \item CSC tight beam halo filter,
    \item HBHE noise filter with isolated noise rejection,
      \item HCAL laser filter,
        \item ECAL dead cell trigger primitive (TP) filter,
          \item Tracking failure filter,
            \item Bad EE Supercrystal filter,
              \item ECAL Laser correction filter.
\end{itemize}
