\section{Noise Filters}
\label{app:noise}

For Calo jets the following criteria were applied:

\begin{itemize}
  \item N90 hits $>$ 1, 
    \item  HBHE $>$ 0.01,
      \item fHPD $<$ 0.98,
\end{itemize}

For PF jets the following criteria were applied:
  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Neutral hadron fraction $<$ 0.99, 
    \item  Neutral EM fraction $<$ 0.99,
      \item Number of constituents $>$ 1,
        \item Charged hadron fraction $>$ 0,
          \item Charged multiplicity $>$ 0,
            \item Charged EM fraction $<$ 0.99.
\end{itemize}
  
The following noise filters are applied, to remove events with spurious, non-physical jets or missing transverse energy.

\begin{itemize}
  \item CSC tight beam halo filter,
    \item HBHE noise filter with isolated noise rejection,
      \item HCAL laser filter,
        \item ECAL dead cell trigger primitive (TP) filter,
          \item Tracking failure filter,
            \item Bad EE Supercrystal filter,
              \item ECAL Laser correction filter.
\end{itemize}
