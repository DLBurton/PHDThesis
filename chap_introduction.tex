\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

During the 20th century, great advances were made in the human understanding of the universe, its origins, its future and its composition. The \acf{SM} first formulated in the 1960s is one of the crowning achievements in science's quest to explain the most fundamental processes and interactions that make up our universe. It has provided a highly successful explanation for a wide range of phenomena in Particle Physics and has stood up to extensive experimental scrutiny \cite{pdg2012}.

Despite its success it is not  a complete theory, with significant questions remaining unanswered. It describes only three of the four known forces with gravity not incorporated within the framework of the \ac{SM}. Cosmological experiments infer that just $\sim$ 4$\%$ of the observable universe exists as matter, with elusive ``Dark Matter'' accounting for a further $\sim$ 23$\%$ \cite{0067-0049-208-2-19}. However no particle predicted by the \ac{SM} is able to account for it.  At higher energy scales and small distances, the (non-)unification of the fundamental forces point to problems with the \ac{SM} at least at higher energies not yet probed experimentally. 

Many theories exist as extensions to the \ac{SM}, predicting a range of observables that can be detected at the \acf{lhc} of which \acf{SUSY} is one such example. It predicts a new symmetry of nature in which all current particles in the \ac{SM} would have a corresponding supersymmetric partner. Common to most Supersymmetric theories is a stable, weakly interacting \acf{LSP}, which has the properties of a possible dark matter candidate. The \ac{SM} and the main principles of Supersymmetric theories are outlined in Chapter \ref{chap:theorysection}, with emphasis placed on how experimental signatures of \ac{SUSY} may reveal themselves in proton collisions at the \ac{lhc}.

The experimental goal of the \ac{lhc} is to further test the framework of the \ac{SM}, exploring the \TeV mass scale for the first time, and to seek a connection between the particles produced in proton collisions and dark matter. The first new discovery by this extraordinary machine was announced on the 4th of July 2012. The long-awaited discovery was the culmination of decades of experimental endeavours in the search for the Higgs boson, which provided an answer to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking within the \ac{SM} \cite{Aad:2012tfa}\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa}. 

This discovery was made possible through the combination of data taken by the two multipurpose detectors (\acf{CMS} and \ac{ATLAS}) located on the \ac{lhc} ring. An experimental description of the \ac{CMS} detector and the \ac{lhc} is described in Chapter \ref{chap:cmsoverview}, including some of the object reconstruction used by \ac{CMS} in searches for \ac{SUSY} signatures. 

The performance of the \ac{CMS} Level-1 single jet trigger, measured over the course of the year, is also included within this chapter. The Level-1 triggers are of paramount importance to the recording of physics events at \ac{CMS}, and to which a change in the jet seed algorithm was introduced approximately half way through the data taking period. The aim of this change, was to reduce the rate at which data events not of interest to physics analysis were recorded, whilst avoiding impact on those which were.

Chapter \ref{chap:SUSYsearches}, contains a description of the search for evidence of the production of Supersymmetric particles at the \ac{lhc}. The main basis of the search centres around the kinematic dimensionless \alphat variable; which provides a strong rejection of backgrounds with fake missing energy signatures, whilst maintaining good sensitivity to a variety of \ac{SUSY} topologies. The author's work (as an integral part of the analysis group) is documented in detail, and has culminated in numerous publications over the past two years, the latest results having been published in the \acf{EPJC} \cite{ra1_epjc}.  The results and interpretations within the framework of a variety of \acf{SMS}, which describe an array of possible \ac{SUSY} event topologies is documented in Chapter \ref{chap:SUSYresults}. 

The author in particular has played a major role in the extension of the \alphat analysis into the additional b-tagged and jet multiplicity dimensions, increasing the sensitivity of the analysis to a range of \ac{SUSY} topologies. Additionally ,the author has worked extensively on both increasing the statistical precision of electroweak predictions measured from simulation through analytical techniques, and the derivation of a data driven systematic uncertainty, through the establishment of closure tests within the control samples of the analysis. 

Finally, a method to search for \ac{SUSY} signatures rich in top and bottom flavoured jet final states, is introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:templatemethod}. These particular \ac{SUSY} topologies are increasingly of interest to physicists in light of the discovery of the Higgs boson, and is discussed within the chapter. A parametrisation of the b-tagging distribution for different Electroweak processes is used to establish template shapes, which are then fitted at low b-tagged jet multiplicity (0-2),  to estimate the expected number of 3 and 4 b-tagged jet events from \ac{SM} processes. The \alphat control and signal region event selections are used to test the functionality of this template method in both data and simulation. Background predictions within the signal region selection are compared to those presented in Chapter \ref{chap:SUSYresults}, with the intention to serve as a independent crosscheck on the estimated \ac{SM} backgrounds from the \alphat search.
