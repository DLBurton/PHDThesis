During the 20th century great advances have been made in the human understanding of the universe, it's origins, it's future and its composition. The \acf{SM} first formulated in the 1960's is one of the crowning achievements in science's quest to explain the most fundamental processes and interactions that make up our universe. It has provided a highly successful explanation of a wide range of phenomena in Particle Physics and has stood up to extensive experimental scrutiny \cite{pdg2012}.

Despite it's successes it is not  a complete theory, with significant questions remaining unanswered. It describes only three of the four known forces with gravity not incoorporated within the framework of the \ac{SM}. Cosmological experiments infer that just $\sim$ 4$\%$ of the observable universe exists as matter, with elusive ``Dark Matter'' accounting for a further $\sim$ 23$\%$ \cite{0067-0049-208-2-19}. However no particle predicted by the \ac{SM} is able to account for it.  At higher energy scales and small distances the (non-)unification of the fundamental forces point to problems with the \ac{SM} at least at higher energies not yet probed experimentally. 

Many theories exist as extensions to the \ac{SM}, which predict a range of observables that can be detected at the \acf{lhc} of which \acf{SUSY} is one such example. It predicts a new symmetry of nature in which all current particles in the \ac{SM} would have a corresponding supersymmetric partner. Common to most Supersymmetric theories is a stable, weakly interacting \acf{LSP}, which has the properties of a possible dark matter candidate. The \ac{SM} and the main principles of Supersymmetric theories are outlined in Chapter \ref{chap:theorysection}, with emphasis placed on how experimental signatures of \ac{SUSY} may reveal themselves at the \ac{lhc}.

The experimental goal of the \ac{lhc} is to further test the framework of the \ac{SM}, exploring the \TeV mass scale for the first time, and to seek a connection between the particles produced in proton collisions and dark matter. The first new discovery by this extraordinary machine was announced on the 4th of July 2012. The long-awaited discovery was the culmination decades of experimental endeavours in the search for the Higgs boson, providing an answer to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking within the \ac{SM} \cite{Aad:2012tfa}\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa}. 

This discovery was made possible through data taken by the two multi purpose detectors (\ac{CMS} and \ac{ATLAS}) located on the \ac{lhc} ring. An experimental description of the \ac{CMS} detector and the \ac{lhc} is described in Chapter \ref{chap:cmsoverview}, including some of the object reconstruction used by \ac{CMS} in searches for \ac{SUSY} signatures. The performance of the \ac{CMS} Level-1 calorimeter trigger, benchmarked by the author is also included within this chapter.

The analysis conducted by the author is detailed within Chapter \ref{chap:SUSYsearches}. This chapter contains a description of the search for evidence of the production of Supersymmetric particles at the \ac{lhc}. The main basis of the search centres around the kinematic dimensionless \alphat variable, which provides strong rejection of backgrounds with fake missing energy signatures whilst maintaining good sensitivity to a variety of \ac{SUSY} topologies. The author's work (as an integral part of the analysis group) is documented in detail, which has culminated in numerous publications over the past two years. The latest of which was published in the \acf{EPJC} \cite{ra1_epjc} and contains the results which are discussed within this and the sequential Chapters. 

The author in particular has played a major role in the extension of the \alphat analysis into the additional b-tagged and jet multiplicity dimensions increasing the sensitivity of the analysis to a range of \ac{SUSY} topologies. Additionally the author has worked extensively in both increasing the statistical precision of electroweak predictions measured from simulation through analytical techniques, and the derivation of a data driven systematic uncertainty through the establishment of closure tests within the control samples of the analysis. 

Additionally a method to search for \ac{SUSY} signatures which are rich in top and bottom flavoured jet final states is disscussd in Chapter \ref{chap:templatemethod}. A parametrisation of the b-tagging distribution for different Electroweak processes is used to establish templates, which are then used to estimate the expected number of 3 or 4 b-tagged jet events from \ac{SM} processes. The \alphat search is used as a cross check for this template method to establish it's functionality. 

Finally the interpretation of such results within the framework of a variety of \acf{SMS}, which describe an array of possible \ac{SUSY} event topologies is documented in Chapter \ref{chap:SUSYresults}. A description of the statistical model used to derive these interpretations and the possible implications of the results presented in this thesis is discussed within this Chapter. Natural units are used throughout this thesis in which \hbarred = c = 1.
