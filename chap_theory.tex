\chapter{A Theoretical Overview}
\label{chap:theorysection}

Within this chapter, a brief introduction and background to the \ac{SM} is given. Its success as a rigorously tested and widely accepted theory is discussed as well as the deficiencies with this theory that hint there this theory is not a complete description of our universe. The motivations for new physics at the \TeV scale and in particular Supersymmetric theories are outlined within Section \ref{sec:susytheory}, with the chapter concluding with how an experimental signature of such theories can be produced and observed at the \ac{lhc}, Section \ref{sec:susysearches}.

\section{The Standard Model}

\label{sec:thesm}

The \ac{SM} is the name given to the relativistic  \acf{QFT}, where particles are represented as excitations of fields, which describes the interactions and properties of all the known elementary particles \cite{PhysRevLett.19.1264}\cite{Glashow:1961tr}\cite{Salam:1968rm}\cite{Hooft1971167}. It is a renormalisable field theory which contains three symmetries: $SU(3)$ for colour charge, SU(2) for weak isospin and U(1) relating to weak hyper charge, which require its Lagrangian \lsm to be invariant under local gauge transformation. 

Within the \ac{SM} theory, matter is composed of spin \half fermions, which interact with each other via the exchange of spin-1 gauge bosons. A summary of the known fundamental fermions and bosons is given in Table \ref{tab:sm_particles}.

Fermions are separated into quarks and leptons of which only quarks interact with the strong nuclear force. Quarks unlike leptons are not seen as free particles in nature, but rather exist only within baryons, composed of three quarks with an overall integer charge, and quark-anti-quark pairs called mesons. Both leptons and quarks are grouped into three generations which have the same properties, but with ascending mass in each subsequent generation. 

The gauge bosons mediate the interactions between fermions. The field theories of \acf{QED} and \acf{QCD}, yield massless mediator bosons, the photon and eight coloured gluons which are consequences of the gauge invariance of those theories, detailed in Section \ref{subsec:gaugetheories}.  

The unification of the electromagnetic and weak-nuclear forces into the current Electroweak theory yield the weak gauge bosons, \Wboson and \Zboson through the mixing of the associated gauge fields. The force carriers of this theory were experimentally detected by the observation of weak neutral current, discovered in 1973 in the Gargamelle bubble chamber located at \ac{CERN} \cite{Hasert:1973ff}, with the masses of and the weak gauge bosons measured by the UA1 and U2 experiments at the \acf{SPS} collider in 1983 \cite{Arnison:1983mk}\cite{Banner:1983jy}.

\subsection{Gauge Symmetries of the SM}

\label{subsec:gaugetheories}

Symmetries are of fundamental importance in the description of physical phenomena. Noether's theorem states that for a dynamical system, the consequence of any symmetry is an associated conserved quantity \cite{Noether1918}. Invariance under translations, rotations, and Lorentz transformations in physical systems lead to conservation of momentum, energy and angular momentum. 

In the \ac{SM}, a quantum theory described by Lagrangian formalism, the weak,strong and electromagnetic interactions are described in terms of ``gauge theories''.  A gauge theory possesses invariance under a set of ``local transformations", which are transformations whose parameters are space-time dependent. The requirement of gauge invariance within the \ac{SM} necessitates the introduction of force-mediating gauge bosons and interactions between fermions and the bosons themselves. Given the nature of the studies carried out in this thesis, the \ac{EWK} part of the \ac{SM} Lagrangian is reviewed within this section.

The simplest example of the application of the principle of local gauge invariance within the \ac{SM} is in \acf{QED}, the consequences of which require a massless photon field \cite{quarksandleptons}\cite{introtoparticles}. 

Starting from the free Dirac Lagrangian written as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diracequation}
\mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} - m)\psi,
\end{equation}

where \fermfield represents a free non interacting fermionic field, with the matrices $\gamma^{\mu}$,$\mu \in  0,1,2,3$ defined by the anti commutator relationship $\gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{\nu}  + \gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{\nu} = 2\eta^{\mu\nu}I_{4}$ where $\eta^{\mu\nu}$ is the flat space-time metric $(+,-,-,-)$ and $I_{4}$ is the 4 $\times$ 4 identity matrix. 

Under a local U(1) abelian gauge transformation in which \fermfield transforms as:

\begin{equation}
\fermfield(x) \rightarrow \fermfield^{'}(x) = e^{i\theta(x)}\fermfield(x) \qquad      \bar{\fermfield}(x) \rightarrow \bar{\fermfield}^{'}(x) = e^{i\theta(x)}\bar{\fermfield}(x)
\end{equation}

the kinetic term of the Lagrangian does not remain invariant, due to the partial derivative interposed between the $\bar{\fermfield}$ and \fermfield yielding,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:remainderterm}
\partial_{\mu}\fermfield \rightarrow  e^{i\theta(x)}\partial_{\mu}\fermfield + ie^{i\theta(x)}\fermfield\partial_{\mu}\theta.
\end{equation} 

To ensure that $\mathcal{L}$ remains invariant, a modified derivative, $D_{\mu}$, that transforms covariantly under phase transformations is introduced. In doing this a vector field $A_{\mu}$ with transformation properties that cancel out the unwanted term in (\ref{eq:remainderterm}) must also be included, 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:afieldtrans}
D_{\mu} \equiv \partial_{\mu} - ieA_{\mu},   \qquad A_{\mu} \rightarrow A_{\mu} + \frac{1}{e}\partial_{\mu}\theta .
\end{equation}

Invariance of the Lagrangian is then achieved by replacing $\partial_{\mu}$ by $D_{\mu}$:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:covlag}
\mathcal{L} &= i\bar{\fermfield}\gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu}\fermfield - m\bar{\fermfield}\fermfield \nonumber    \\
 &= \bar{\fermfield}(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} - m)\fermfield +  e\bar{\fermfield}\gamma^{\mu}\fermfield A_{\mu}
\end{align}


An additional interaction term is now present in the Lagrangian, coupling the Dirac particle to this vector field, which is interpreted as the photon in \ac{QED}. To regard this new field as the physical photon field, a term corresponding to its kinetic energy must be added to the Lagrangian in (\ref{eq:covlag}). Since this term must also be invariant under (\ref{eq:afieldtrans}), it is defined in the form $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial^{\mu}A^{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}A{\mu}$. 

This then leads to the Lagrangian of \ac{QED}: 

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{QED} =.\overbrace{i\bar{\fermfield}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\fermfield - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} }^\text{kinetic term} + \overbrace{m\bar{\fermfield}\fermfield}^\text{mass term} + \overbrace{e\bar{\fermfield}\gamma^{\mu}\fermfield A_{\mu} }^\text{interaction term}
\end{equation}

Within the Lagrangian there remains no mass term of the form $m^{2}A_{\mu}A^{\mu}$, which is prohibited by gauge invariance. This implies that the gauge particle, the photon, must be massless.


\subsection{The Electroweak Sector and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking}

\label{subsec:ewsb}
The same application of gauge symmetry and the requirement of local gauge invariance can be used to unify \ac{QED} and the Weak force in the \acf{EWK}. The nature of \ac{EWK} interactions is encompassed within a Lagrangian invariant under transformations of the group $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)_{Y}$. 

The $SU(2)_{L}$ group is the special unitary group of $2 \times 2$ matrices $U$ satisfying $UU^{\dagger} = I$ and $det(U) = 1$. This may be written as 

\begin{equation}
U = e^{-i\theta_{i}T_{i}},
\end{equation}

with $T_{i} = \frac{1}{2}\tau_{i}$ where $\tau_{i}$, $i \in$ 1,2,3 are the $2 \times 2$ Pauli matrices, which form a non Abelian group obeying the commutation relation $[T^{a},T^{b}] \equiv  if^{abc}T^{c} \neq 0$. One additional generator $Y$ is introduced through the $U(1)_{Y}$ group. 

Show how they transform on fermion fieldÉ..

The gauge fields introduced by the theory are $\hat{W}_{\mu}  = (\hat{W}^{1}_{\mu},\hat{W}^{2}_{\mu},\hat{W}^{3}_{\mu}  ) $ and $\hat{B}_{\mu}$, which establish gauge invariance within the $\mathcal{L}_{EWK}$ by including the covariant derivative

\begin{equation}
D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} - \frac{ig}{2}\sigma^{i}W^{i}_{\mu} - \frac{ig^{'}}{2}Y B_{\mu}
\end{equation}

where $g$ and $g^{'}$ are the coupling constant of the $SU(2)_{L}$ and $U(1)_{Y}$ groups.

As in \ac{QED}, these additional gauge fields introduce field strength tensors $B_{\mu\nu}$ and $W^{\theta}_{\mu\nu}$,

\begin{equation}
B_{\mu\nu} =  \\
W^{\theta}_{\mu\nu} =      .
\end{equation}

Put how combining the gauge fields produce the W and Z bosons.

\section{Motivation for Beyond the Standard Model Physics}

\label{sec:bsmmotivation}

As previously described, the \ac{SM} is a successful theory, predicting the existence of the \Wboson and \Zboson bosons and the top quark long before they were experimentally observed. However the theory does not fully explainÉ.

\section{Searching for SUSY at the LHC}
\label{sec:susysearches}

\subsection{Simplified Models}

\label{subsec:sms}

With such a variety of different way for a \ac{SUSY} signal to manifest itself, it is necessary to be able to interpret experimental reach through the masses of gluinos and squarks which can excluded by experimental searches rather than on a model specific basis. This is accomplished through \acf{SMS} models, which are \ac{SUSY} decays which contain only one process. For example the production of a pair of gluinos which then decay via \ac{SM} processes, to a set decay topology with a 100$\%$ branching ratio, shown in É.

Searching and interpreting \ac{SUSY} searches in this wayÉ.

The convention for the naming of these \ac{SMS} models is via the prefix...
