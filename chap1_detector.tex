%% Note that the citations in this chapter use the journal and 
%% arXiv keys: I used the SLAC-SPIRES online BibTeX retriever 
%% to build my bibliography. There are also quite a few non-standard
%% macros, which come from my personal collection. You can have them
%% if you want, or I might get round to properly releasing them at 
%% some point myself.
